# any configuration bellow is not mandatory, you can delete any of the tags if you're not gonna use it 
# HOWEVER, it's important to note that the bot is incredibly slow when running without filters 

# filters the message with Bits
#show_bit_gifters: true

# shold create a log.txt file 
#log_file: false

# records sent messages and display them whenever someone gets timed out / banned
#mod_actions: true

# filtering by badges only work if the badge is visible.
# you can check the log.txt to see what badges are being used by users
# Ex.: you have a filter for `verified`, but then a verified gifted 1000 bits. 
# Now that verified has a `1000 gifter` badge in place of the `verified` one and won't show anymore.
#filter_badges: 
#  - broadcaster
#  - vip
#  - moderator

# this uses the username, not the display name.
# in the log.txt it will be like this: 
# USERNAME (DISPLAY_NAME)
#filter_usernames: 
#  - soundalerts

# this uses regex. Go nuts 
#filter_messages:
#  - '[^\x20-\x7F]' # this regex detects any message that uses non roman characters, like Chinese, Japanese, etc.

# this translates twitch emotes to an equivalent you might have on your server, or any server.
# you can create a server for just dumping twitch emotes if you don't want them to clog your original one.
# no nitro needed
# this only translates twitch emotes by looking at what emotes people can use
#
# To get these codes you can use \ before the emote ( \:HenyaDance: )

# or you can create a separate file with the same content and host it on the web.
# You can upload your file into a github repo, get the raw link, and use it here
# that the bot will try to update it every 10 seconds.
# Just beware that when using github the raw file is kept in cache for 3 minutes.
# so you'll only see a change in around 3 minutes after updating it on github.
